\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Location}: The test takes place inside and outside the arena.

	\item \textbf{Start Location}: The robot starts at a predefined location in the living house.

	\item \textbf{Operator}: At the start, the operator is standing in front of the robot.
	
	\item \textbf{Bags' Location:} There are at least two bags placed between one to two meters away from the operator's start position and both should be visible to the robot.
	
	\item \textbf{Pointing to the Bag:} When the test starts, the operator points to a bag and requests the robot to carry it to the car.
	
	\item \textbf{Operator's Bag:} The bag which is pointed is placed such that the robot's hand can reach it.
	
	\item \textbf{Outdoor Obstacles:} The robot will face four obstacles outside. The obstacles will include a crowd obstructing path, a small 3D object placed on ground, a small moving toy-car, and a small area blocked using retractable barriers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
