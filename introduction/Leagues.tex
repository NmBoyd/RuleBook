\section{Leagues}
\label{sec:leagues}

\iterm{RoboCup@Home} is divided into three leagues. Two of them are \Term{Standard Platform League}{SPL}s in which all competitors use the same robot, and an \Term{Open Platform League}{} with no strict hardware requirements. The official leagues are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Term{RoboCup@Home Domestic Standard Platform League}{RoboCup@Home DSPL}
  \item \Term{RoboCup@Home Social Standard Platform League}{RoboCup@Home SSPL}
  \item \Term{RoboCup@Home Open Platform League}{RoboCup@Home OPL}
\end{itemize}

Each league highlights different aspects of service robotics and requires specific abilities.


\subsection{Domestic Standard Platform League}
The \iterm{Domestic Standard Platform League's} (DSPL) main goal is to assist humans in a domestic environment, paying special attention to elderly people and people suffering of illness or disability. In consequence, the DSPL focuses on Ambient Intelligence, Computer Vision, Object Manipulation, Safe Indoor Navigation and Mapping, and Task Planning.

The robot to be used in the DSPL is the Toyota HSR, shown in Figure \ref{fig:toyotaHSR}.

\subsection{Social Standard Platform League}
A 180 degree turn in Human Robot Interaction, the \iterm{Social Standard Platform League}(SSPL) takes robots away from the traditional passive servant role and has the robot actively look for interaction. From a party waiter in a home environment to a hostess in a museum or shopping mall, in \iterm{SSPL} robots look for the next user who may require its services. Hence, this league focuses on Human-Robot Interaction, Natural Language Processing, People Detection and Recognition, Reactive Behaviors, and Safe Outdoor Navigation and Mapping.

The robot to be used in the SSPL is the Softbank/Aldebaran Pepper, shown in Figure \ref{fig:softbank-pepper}.

\subsection{Open Platform League}
The \iterm{Open Platform League}(OPL) has the same modus operandi used since the foundation of RoboCup@Home till 2017 when \iterm{Standard Platform Leagues} were created. With no hardware constraints, OPL is the league for teams who want to test their own robot designs and configurations. Although similar in scope to the DSPL, in the OPL robots are tested to their limits without having design restrictions in mind.
